responses:
  utter_depression_action_plan:
  - text: Seems like your suffering from a mild to medium case of depression. Choose people who you can talk to or who can do your activities with you. Talk to them about how you feel. If you can't talk about it, that's okay.
  utter_anxiety_action_plan:
  - text: Seems like your suffering from a mild to medium case of anxiety. How you think affects how you feel. Anxiety can make you overestimate the danger in a situation and underestimate your ability to handle it. Try to think of different interpretations to a situation that's making you anxious, rather than jumping to the worst-case scenario. Look at the facts for and against your thought being true.
